1) inline, internal, external css

2) type, class, attribute, id selectors, universal selector(*)
    CSS can select HTML elements by type(tag name), class, ID, and attribute.

3) pseudo selectors
    An element can have different states using the pseudo-class selector.

4) classes and ids (multiple classes to a single tag seperated by space)
    Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.

5) specificity
    Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.
    IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than type. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, 
    and classes will override any styles from a type selector.

6) chaining
    Combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining.
    Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity but can be necessary.

7) Descendant Combinator
    Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space

8) Chaining and Specificity
    specificity increases with additional selectors

9) Multiple Selectors seperated by comma
    Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.
